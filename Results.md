These five user IDs surfaced as the **highest-risk accounts** because of their exceptionally large transaction sizesâ€”classic indicators of potential fraud.

### Interpretation
* **High-Value Anomalies:** Transactions exceeding \$10,000 were key in identifying these users.
* **Explainability:** Each risk score is backed by rule-based flags (high-value, first-time card payment, velocity bursts, and country mismatch).
