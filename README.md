# Financial-Crime-Analytics-Fraud-Detection-using-SQL-

Detect anomalies and surface high-risk customers from >50,000 transactions using **pure SQL**.  
The project standardizes multi-currency amounts to USD, computes rule-based risk signals, and ranks users by a composite fraud score—designed to be simple, transparent, and auditable.

## 🔎 Highlights

- **Real-world simulation:** 50k+ transactions, diverse currencies, merchant categories, and user KYC signals.
- **Multi-currency normalization:** Converts amounts to USD using currency exponents and FX rates.
- **Risk rules you can audit:**
  - High-value transactions (>$10,000 USD)
  - Abnormal **first-time card payments**
  - Country/geo inconsistencies (user vs merchant)
  - Suspicious entry methods (e.g., old magstripe swipes)
  - Velocity bursts (many payments in short windows)
- **Actionable output:** Ranked list of **high-risk users** missed by the existing fraud list.
- **Explainability:** Each flag includes **why** it was triggered.
